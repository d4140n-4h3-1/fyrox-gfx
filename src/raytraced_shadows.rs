//! Shadows traced against the scene's geometry, for every light.
//!
//! A shadow map is a picture of the scene from the light's point of view, and everything about it -
//! the stair-stepped edges, the peter-panning, the cascades - comes from it being a picture at a
//! fixed resolution. It also has to be drawn again every frame for every light, six times over for
//! a lamp, which is why a scene full of lamps can only afford shadows for the nearest few, and why
//! shadows come and go as the camera moves. Tracing asks the geometry directly instead: for each
//! pixel a light reaches, is there a triangle between it and the light? The answer is exact at any
//! distance, with no maps to size, no cascades to blend, and no bias to tune beyond keeping a
//! surface from shadowing itself - and its cost is the pixels lit, not the scene redrawn.
//!
//! This needs ray tracing hardware. [`TracedLightShadows`] is handed to the renderer as its
//! [`LightShadowTracer`]: the renderer asks it for a shadow mask for each light just before
//! drawing that light, and uses the mask in place of the light's shadow map, so the shadow darkens
//! that light alone. Without the hardware it returns no masks and the renderer's shadow maps are
//! used as before.
//!
//! Lights are given a size, and a few rays per pixel are spread across it, so a shadow's edge
//! softens where only part of the light is hidden - wider the further the shadow falls from what
//! casts it, as a real one does. The mask is then blurred a little, only across the same surface,
//! to smooth out the differences between neighboring pixels. One ray per pixel gives hard shadows
//! and skips the blur.
//!
//! Each mesh's triangles are put into the hardware's structure once, in the mesh's own space -
//! once for every mesh made from the same surface data, such as a maze's repeated tiles - and every
//! frame a copy of each is placed wherever its mesh is, so what moves casts its shadow from where
//! it is. Most of a scene never moves, though, and placing thousands of copies every frame costs
//! more than tracing against them: so a mesh that has stood still for a second
//! ([`SETTLE_FRAMES`]) is put in with the others standing still in the same cube of space
//! ([`BATCH_CELL`]), as one piece of geometry already where they all are, placed once. A maze of
//! thousands of walls is traced as a few hundred pieces. When a mesh that was put in moves, or
//! goes, or one comes to stand still beside them, only its cube is put together again; and when
//! nothing has moved or changed since the last frame, the scene is not placed again at all.
//!
//! A skinned mesh's triangles are skinned by its bones every frame, as the renderer draws
//! them, and refitted - within [`SKIN_REACH`] of the camera; further off, its shadow stays as it
//! last was, too small to tell. Each skinned surface's vertices, and the bones and weights they
//! hang off, are read once and kept, so that posing them is only the arithmetic; and a surface
//! whose bones have not moved since it was last posed - a body lying still, say - is not posed
//! again, nor its geometry refitted: it casts the shadow it last did, at no cost. Hidden meshes
//! still cast shadows while they stand still, since a game hides what the camera cannot see; once a mesh has moved, or if it is skinned, it casts none while
//! hidden, as with shadow maps.
//!
//! Glass stands in light's way too, but lets it through, taking on its colour: a lamp shone
//! through red glass casts red light past it. How much of each colour gets through is the glass's
//! tint, as strongly as its tint strength; glass told not to colour light
//! ([`crate::GlassMaterial::tints_light`]) is left out, and light goes through it as if it were not
//! there. The light is only coloured, not bent: where the glass would focus it, it does not.
